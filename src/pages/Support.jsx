    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>Many parents or wider family members want to give back to The Little Miracles Trust to acknowledge the support that they received. The first step is to connect with us so you can keep in touch with what is happening both locally and across New Zealand.
<br /> <br />
You may also wish to become a volunteer, helping out in any big or small way you can.</p>

        <h2>National Awareness campaign</h2>
        <p>November brings our national awareness campaign -“Neonatal November”  a time where we recognise the 5000 babies and families who who spend time in a Neonatal Unit (NICU or SCBU) every year.  Along with this is World Prematurity Day,  17 November, and we are planning on undertaking a range of activities to both increase the awareness of The Little Miracles Trust and raise funds. Volunteer support will be key in ensuring that the National Awareness campaign is as successful as it can be. More details will be available closer to the time and the best way to keep in touch with this (and other news) is to connect with us.</p>
